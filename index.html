      <p class="center">Hey, I'm Alexander Harding!</p>
      <p class="center">I am a ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Canadian Software Developer studying at Mohawk College.</p>
      <p class="center">I have been coding since the March 2020 (The start of the Lockdowns in Canada)</p>
      <p class="padded">I go by Backwards User online, and I have a sort of pseudo organization called <a
          href="https://backwardsdevelopment.ca/">Backwards Development</a>.
        I started my career developing Discord bots for my servers and friends, I eventually transitioned towards
        web/app development after guidence from
        family and friends. I have begun to love coding, programing and the problem solving that entails. I hope to, in
        the future get a job at an application
        development firm or a company that develops certain applications, my first choice would be Discord itself,
        They're who introduced me to coding, its only
        fitting I give back and help develop the application that I use on a daily basis, Discord is most likely my
        favourite platform at the moment as it allows
        you to connect with anyone you'd like at the click of a button, Discord not only allows you to talk to friends,
        but make friends who have the same interests
        or hobbies as you. You can also use Discord to pick up to interest and hobbies allowing you to expand your
        horizons and friend circles.</p>
      <h3 class="h3-pad">Education</h3>
      <p class="side-pad">I am currently studying at Mohawk College.</p>
      <p class="side-pad">I am taking the course "Computer Systems Technology Software Development"</p>
      <h3 class="h3-pad">My stuff</h3>
      <p class="side-pad">I have worked on multiple interesting projects from Discord bots, to my own (reduemntary) Messaging Application.
        Check them about at my <a href="/projects">Projects page</a>!</p>
      <h3 class="h3-pad">My Interests</h3>
      <p class="side-pad">I like to play Video Games, my favourite at the moment of writing this are Minecraft, Rainbow Six Siege, Helldivers 2 and Satisfactory.</p>
      <p class="side-pad">I'm interested in 3D Printing, I used to own a printer, but it has since broke, although I am looking into getting another.
        I am also interested in AI and AI tools like google's gemini, Midjourney, and ElevenLabs.</p>
